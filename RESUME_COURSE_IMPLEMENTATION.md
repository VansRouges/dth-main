# Resume Course & Completion Stats Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Resume Course Functionality
- **File**: `lib/resume-course.ts`
- **Purpose**: Implements smart course resumption that takes users to their next uncompleted lesson
- **Functions**:
  - `getNextUncompletedLesson()`: Finds the next lesson that hasn't been completed
  - `getResumeCoursePath()`: Returns the correct path for course resumption

### 2. Course Page Update
- **File**: `app/(user)/my-learning/[courseId]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Updated to use resume functionality instead of always starting from the first lesson
- **Behavior**: When users click on a course, they're redirected to their next uncompleted lesson

### 3. Completion Statistics
- **File**: `sanity/lib/student/getCompletedCoursesCount.ts`
- **Purpose**: Calculates accurate course completion statistics
- **Functions**:
  - `getCompletedCoursesCount()`: Returns count of 100% completed courses
  - `getDetailedCompletionStats()`: Returns detailed stats (completed, in progress, not started)

### 4. My Learning Page Updates
- **File**: `app/(user)/my-learning/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Imports completion stats function
  - Updates stats cards to show accurate completion counts
  - Shows "In Progress" count instead of "Certifications"

### 5. Learning Cards Enhancement
- **File**: `components/learning-cards.tsx`
- **Changes**: Updated button text to be more specific:
  - "Start Learning" for 0% progress
  - "Resume Learning" for partial progress
  - "Review Course" for 100% completion

## How Resume Course Works

1. When a user clicks on a course card in my-learning
2. They're redirected to `/my-learning/[courseId]`
3. The course page calls `getNextUncompletedLesson()`
4. This function:
   - Gets the user's course progress
   - Identifies completed lessons
   - Finds the first uncompleted lesson in module order
   - Returns the lesson ID
5. User is redirected to the specific lesson page

## Error Handling

- All functions include try-catch blocks
- Uses `Promise.allSettled()` for robust parallel processing
- Fallback behavior when data isn't available
- Console logging for debugging

## Benefits

✅ Users resume where they left off instead of starting over
✅ Accurate completion statistics in the dashboard
✅ Better user experience with smart navigation
✅ Robust error handling prevents crashes
✅ Maintains existing functionality while adding new features
